Jaxon Library for CakePHP
=========================

This package integrates the [Jaxon library](https://github.com/jaxon-php/jaxon-core) into the CakePHP 3 framework.

Features
--------

- Read Jaxon options from a file in CakePHP config format.
- Automatically register Jaxon classes from a preset directory.

Installation
------------

First install CakePHP version 3.

Create the `composer.json` file into the installation dir with the following content.
```json
{
    "require": {
        "jaxon-php/jaxon-cake": "~2.0",
    }
}
```

Add the Jaxon plugin in the `vendor/cakephp-plugins.php` file.
```php
return [
    'plugins' => [
        ...
        'Jaxon/Cake' => $baseDir . '/vendor/jaxon-php/jaxon-cake/',
    ]
];
```

Load the Jaxon plugin in the controller or in the bootstrap file.
```php
Plugin::load('Jaxon/Cake', array('autoload' => true, 'routes' => true));
```

Load the Jaxon component in the controller.
```php
$this->loadComponent('Jaxon/Cake.Jaxon');
```

Configuration
------------

The settings in the `config/jaxon.php` config file are separated into two sections.
The options in the `lib` section are those of the Jaxon core library, while the options in the `app` sections are those of the CakePHP application.

The following options can be defined in the `app` section of the config file.

| Name | Default value | Description |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| controllers.directory | ROOT . '/jaxon/Controller' | The directory of the Jaxon classes |
| controllers.namespace | \Jaxon\App  | The namespace of the Jaxon classes |
| controllers.separator | .           | The separator in Jaxon class names |
| controllers.protected | empty array | Prevent Jaxon from exporting some methods |
| | | |

Usage
-----

This is an example of a CakePHP controller using the Jaxon library.
```php
namespace App\Controller;

class DemoController extends AppController
{
    public function initialize()
    {
        parent::initialize();
        // Load the Jaxon component
        $this->loadComponent('Jaxon/Cake.Jaxon');
    }

    public function index()
    {
        // Call the Jaxon module
        $this->Jaxon->register();

        $this->set('jaxonCss', $this->Jaxon->css());
        $this->set('jaxonJs', $this->Jaxon->js());
        $this->set('jaxonScript', $this->Jaxon->script());
        $this->render('demo');
    }
}
```

Before it prints the page, the controller makes a call to `$this->Jaxon->register()` to export the Jaxon classes.
Then it calls the `$this->Jaxon->css()`, `$this->Jaxon->js()` and `$this->Jaxon->script()` functions to get the CSS and javascript codes generated by Jaxon, which it inserts in the page.

### The Jaxon classes

The Jaxon classes must inherit from `\Jaxon\Cake\Controller`.

The Jaxon classes of the application must all be located in the directory indicated by the `app.controllers.directory` option in the `config/jaxon.php` config file.
If there is a namespace associated, the `app.controllers.namespace` option should be set accordingly.

By default, the Jaxon classes are located in the `ROOT/jaxon/Controller` dir of the CakePHP application, and the associated namespace is `\Jaxon\App`.
